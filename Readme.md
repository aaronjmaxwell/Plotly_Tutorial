# Plotly_Tutorial
This repository showcases my time learning the plotly landscape.  All JavaScript originally written by Plotly, Inc. and distributed under the MIT license.  This repository uses the same license
because of this.  The only original content is in the html and css files, with some tweaks to the JavaScript to prevent the < div > tags generated by Plotly embedding the Plotly.newPlot arguments.  Instead, they are read in using d3.json.  To create the json objects, either install a local version of plotly using pip or dump arguments as json objects.  See the slides for more details.
